; To create new recipes, the two Elves combine their current recipes.
; This creates new recipes from the digits of the sum of the current recipes' scores.
;  With the current recipes' scores of 3 and 7, their sum is 10, and so two new recipes would be created:
;       the first with score 1 and the second with score 0.
;  If the current recipes' scores were 2 and 3, the sum, 5,
;       would only create one recipe (with a score of 5) with its single digit.

; After all new recipes are added to the scoreboard, each Elf picks a new current recipe.
; To do this,
;   the Elf steps forward through the scoreboard a number of recipes equal to 1 plus the score of their current recipe.
;   So, after the first round, the first Elf moves forward 1 + 3 = 4 times, while the second Elf moves forward 1 + 7 = 8 times.
;   If they run out of recipes, they loop back around to the beginning.
;   After the first round, both Elves happen to loop around until they land on the same recipe that they had in the beginning;
;   in general, they will move to different recipes.
